## Welcome & Hello
Hi my name is James. I've started software development when I was 14, 17 years ago. I have never started a blog before cause it always seamed alittle braggy when an fellow developer would post about their own project. That being said that's most likely my bias of liking to be quiet and just letting my work speak for itself. My hope for this blog is to share things I find interesting along with maybe helping other developers with a few walkthroughs overtime.
